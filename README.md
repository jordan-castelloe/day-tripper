# Day Tripper

This is a random day trip generator built with Google Maps Javascript API. 

You can use your current location as a starting point or search any location around the world. Pick how far you want to drive and it pulls up random attractions in that radius.

This project was inspired by Lonely Planet's book "Experimental Travel", which has lots of other fun travel games.

You can find a project demo [here](https://jordan-castelloe.github.io/day-tripper/).
